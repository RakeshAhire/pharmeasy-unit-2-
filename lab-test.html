        </div>

        <div>
            <h2>Lab Test Booking Made Simple</h2>
            <span>One of the most popular services PharmEasy offers is diagnostic testing. People need to book
                pathological tests for many reasons. But before booking, they wonder if the <b>diagnostic center </b>
                can be trusted to produce accurate results and how long they might have to wait in a queue to get
                tested.</span> <br> <br>


            <p>
                To ease your anxieties, PharmEasy offers the facility of doorstep collection. The technician will come
                to your house to collect samples. And all safety precautions are maintained. A fresh collection kit
                and/or needle will be used so that there is no contamination of samples of the spread of diseases. We
                use special ice boxes that meet NABL guidelines to transport your samples. The reports will be sent to
                you online. That means you won’t have to travel to the diagnostic lab to collect your reports.

                <div>
                    <h2>What are the covid precautions PharmEasy is taking for the testing purpose?</h2>

                    <p>
                        PharmEasy takes safety of our patients and staff very seriously. Which is why since the onset of
                        COVID-19, we formulated a 5-step safety program to offer 100% protection to all stakeholders..
                        Along with this, NABL guidelines are followed to ensure samples are not corrupted during
                        collection, transportation or storage. Here are the safety measures that we adhere to-Vigilance
                        about face masksHand hygiene including sanitization and wearing of glovesFrequent thermal
                        checksHygienic sample collectionCareful disposal of wasteCheck flu symptoms with patients

                    <h2>Are the phlebotomists sufficiently qualified?</h2>

                    <p>
                        PharmEasy owns 18 state-of-the-art diagnostic laboratories in the country with an inhouse fleet
                        of 500 phlebotomists across 2500+ pincodes. We have a dedicated training team for the
                        technicians which constantly track their performance on parameters like on time arrival,
                        painless collection, adherence to NABL guidelines for sample storage & transport and customer
                        support. We have a very strict hiring process which ensures that every sample collection
                        experience is best in class.

                <div>
                    <h2>How efficient is the sample collection and analysis process?</h2>

                    <p>Utmost care is taken to collect samples while maintaining complete hygiene. Only new and fresh
                        collection kits and needles are used. After collection, the sample is immediately transferred
                        into an icebox to prevent degradation and bacterial build-up which may lead to inaccurate
                        diagnosis. The samples are barcode tagged to prevent mix up and in the laboratories, technicians
                        use high-end, state-of-the-art devices to analyse the samples.</p>

                <div>
                    <h2>Why are lab tests essential?</h2>

                    <p>
                        Lab tests or diagnostic tests are recommended by doctors when they suspect that there might be
                        something wrong with your health. Samples of your blood, stool, urine, or mucus can reveal a lot
                        about the state of your health when analysed with special devices. Once the problem is detected,
                        your doctor can diagnose and put you on medication or suggest a course of treatment.

                    </h2>
                    <p>Different tests have different requirements. Some may need to be on an empty stomach whereas, for
                        some other tests, you may need to consume food before the sample is collected. Speak with your
                        doctor regarding what you need to do to prepare for a lab test. Let your doctor know if you are
                        already on any medication.</p>

                    <h2>
                        How are lab test reports interpreted?
                    </h2>

                    <p>
                        The reports that our labs will deliver to you will be quite detailed. There will be charts of
                        reference ranges to help you understand the report and a statement from a qualified doctor. But,
                        once you receive your report, it is best to consult your doctor and ask him/her to explain it to
                        you.
                    </p>

                    <h2>
                        If the lab test results are within normal range, does that mean no illness has been detected?
                    </h2>

                    <p>If your reports are within normal range, it is certainly good news. But normal results do not
                        always give you a clean bill of health. If symptoms persist, your doctor will recommend other
                        tests to detect what is triggering the unusual signs.</p>
